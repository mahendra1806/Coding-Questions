Intuition
Calculate the minimum key presses required to type a string by grouping characters and assigning key presses based on their frequency.

Approach
Count Frequencies: Use a counter to tally occurrences of each character.
Sort Frequencies: Order characters by frequency in descending order.
Assign Push Counts: Characters are assigned pushes based on their position in groups of 8.
Calculate Total Pushes: Compute the total presses needed based on character frequency and push group.

class Solution:
    def minimumPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
        freq=Counter(word)
        sorted_freq=sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
        total=0
        key=8
        for i, count in enumerate(sorted_freq):
            group_number=i//key
            total+=count*(group_number+1)
        return total
